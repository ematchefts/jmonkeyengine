AtlasBatchGeometryVisualPanel1.jTextArea1.text=Note that all the textures of the batched geometry have to fit in the atlas texture, else not all will be added to the atlas. There is no scaling happening!\n\nAlso note that when batching geometry with normal maps you have to make sure the current normal map and color/diffuse map etc. match in size for each geometry. \nE.g. a model with a diffuse map of 256x256 has to use a normal map with 256x256 pixels as well.
