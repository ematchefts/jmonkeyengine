<h1><a>Spatial</a></h1><div><p>This is an introduction to the concept of Spatials, the elements of the 3D scene graph. The scene graph is a data structure that manages all objects in your 3D world. For example, the scene graph keeps track of the 3D models that you load and position. When you extend a Java class from com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication, you automatically inherit the scene graph and its rootNode.</p><p>The rootNode is the central element of the scene graph. Even if the scenegraph is empty, it always has at least its rootNode. All other Spatials are <em>attached</em> to the rootNode in a parent-child relationship. If you think you need to understand the scene graph concept better, please read <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/scenegraph_for_dummies.html">Scenegraph for dummies</a> first.</p></div><h2><a>Node versus Geometry</a></h2><div><p>In your Java code, a Spatial is either a com.jme3.scene.Node or a com.jme3.scene.Geometry. You use the two for different purposes:</p><p><img src="nbdocs:/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/intermediate/scene-graph.png"></p><div><table><tr><td></td><th>com.jme3.scene.Spatial</th></tr><tr><th>Purpose:</th><td>A Spatial is an abstract data structure that stores transformations (translation, rotation, scale) of elements of the scene graph.

<p>

<p><div>You never create a Spatial with <code>Spatial s = new Spatial();</code>! A Spatial is an abstract concept, like a mammal (there is no actual creature called &quot;mammal&quot; walking around here). You create a Node, or load a Geometry object. Some methods however require a Spatial argement: This is because they are able to accept both Nodes and Geometries as arguments. In this case, you must cast a Node or Geometry to Spatial.

<h3><a>Mesh</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

The polygon <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/mesh.html">Mesh</a> inside a Geometry can be one of three things:

</p>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Shapes:</strong> The simplest type of Meshes are jME&#039;s default <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/shape.html">Shape</a>s such as cubes and spheres. You can use several Shapes to build complex Geometries. Shapes are built-in and can be created without using the AssetManager.</div>
</li>
<li><div> <strong>3D Models:</strong> <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/3d_models.html">3D models and scenes</a> are also made up of meshes, but are more complex than Shapes. You create Models and Scenes in external 3D Mesh Editors and export them as Ogre <acronym title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> or Wavefront OBJ. Use the <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/asset_manager.html">Asset Manager</a> to load models into a your jME3 game.</div>
</li>
<li><div> <strong>Custom Meshes:</strong> Advanced users can create <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/custom_meshes.html">Custom Meshes</a> programmatically.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2><a>How to Add Fields and Methods to a Spatial</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

You can include custom Java objects in Nodes and Geometries. This is useful for maintaining information about a game element, such as health, budget, ammunition, inventory, equipment, etc for players, or landmark locations for terrains, and much more. 
</p>

<p>
You do not need to create a custom class that extends Node or Geometry to be able to add custom fields to a spatial – use the setUserData() method instead. Neither do need to create a custom class that extends Node to be able to add custom accessor methods to this spatial – use a Control instead. Where ever the spatial is accessible, you can also access the object&#039;s game data and accessors. 
</p>

<p>
For example when you initialize your custom PlayerControl class:

</p>
<pre>// init custom data fields in this Control's Spatial (Node or Geometry)
spatial.setUserData&#40;&quot;Health&quot;, 100&#41;; </pre>

<p>

In your PlayerControl, you offer accessors that manipulate and get this custom data: 

</p>
<pre>public int getHealth&#40;&#41; &#123;
  return &#40;Integer&#41;spatial.getUserData&#40;&quot;Health&quot;&#41;;
&#125;
public void setHealth&#40;int h&#41; &#123;
  spatial.setUserData&#40;&quot;Health&quot;,h&#41;;
&#125;</pre>

<p>

Elsewhere in your code, you can access this data wherever you have access to the spatial. 

</p>
<pre>health = player_node.getControl&#40;PlayerControl.class&#41;.getHealth&#40;&#41;;
...
player_node.getControl&#40;PlayerControl.class&#41;.setHealth&#40;99&#41;;</pre>

<p>
You can add as many data objects (including Strings, Integers, Floats, Arrays,) to a Spatial as you need. Just make sure to label them with different Strings (<code>health</code>, <code>inventory</code>, <code>equipment</code>, etc). The saved data can also be custom Java objects if you make the Java class implement the Savable interface. When you save a Spatial as a j3o file, the custom data is saved too, and it will be restored the next time you load the j3o!
</p>

<p>

You can list all data keys that are already defined for one Spatial:
</p>
<pre>for&#40;String key : spatial.getUserDataKeys&#40;&#41;&#41;&#123;
      System.out.println&#40;spatial.getName&#40;&#41;+&quot;'s keys: &quot;+key&#41;;
&#125;</pre>

</div>

<h2><a>How to Access a Named Sub-Mesh</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

Often after you load a scene or model, you need to access a part of it as an individual Geometry in the scene graph. Maybe you want to swap a character&#039;s weapon, or you want to play a door-opening animation. First you need to know the unique name of the sub-mesh.

</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Open the model in a 3D mesh editor, or in the jMonkeyEngine <acronym title="Software Development Kit">SDK</acronym>&#039;s Scene Composer. </div>
</li>
<li><div> Find out the existing names of sub-meshes in the model.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Assign unique names to sub-meshes in the model if neccessary.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

In the following example, the Node <code>house</code> is the loaded model. The sub-meshes in the Node are called its children. The String, here <code>door 12</code>, is the name of the mesh that you are searching. 
</p>
<pre>Geometry submesh = &#40;Geometry&#41; houseScene.getChild&#40;&quot;door 12&quot;&#41;;</pre>
