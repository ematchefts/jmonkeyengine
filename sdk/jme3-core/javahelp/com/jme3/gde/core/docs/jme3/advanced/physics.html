<code>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace().enableDebug(assetManager);</code>
</div></p>
</p>

<p>
Let&#039;s look at examples of how to use the CollisionShape constructor:
</p>

</div>

<h3><a>CollisionShape Code Samples</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

MeshCompoundShape and MeshCollisionShape are both mesh-accurate and are intended for immobile scene entities, such as terrains, buildings, or whole shooter levels. Limitation: Only collisions of non-mesh-accurate shapes (sphere, box, etc) shapes can be detected against mesh-accurate shapes.

</p>
<pre>CompoundCollisionShape myComplexShape =
    CollisionShapeFactory.createMeshShape&#40;&#40;Node&#41; myComplexGeometry &#41;;</pre>

<p>
An angular, non-mesh-accurate compound shape:
</p>
<pre>CompoundCollisionShape boxShape =
    CollisionShapeFactory.createBoxCompoundShape&#40;&#40;Node&#41; someBox&#41;;</pre>

<p>
SphereCollisionShape, BoxCollisionShape, CapsuleCollisionShape are also not mesh-accurate, but have better performance. The can be added to anything, and collisions between them and any other shape can be detected.
</p>
<pre>SphereCollisionShape sphereShape =
    new SphereCollisionShape&#40;1.0f&#41;;</pre>

</div>

<h2><a>PhysicsControls</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

BulletPhysics are available in jME3 through Bullet Physics Controls from the com.jme3.bullet.control package. PhysicsControls are the recommended way to use physics in a jME3 application. PhysicsControls are flexible and can be added to any Spatial to make it act according to physical properties. jME&#039;s PhysicsControl classes directly extend Bullet Physics objects. 

</p>
<div><table>
	<tr>
		<th>Physics Control</th><th>Purpose</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RigidBodyControl</td><td>Use for dynamic physical entities in the scene – things that are freely affected by physical forces such as collisions, forces, or changing gravity. For example: Impacting projectiles, moving obstacles like crates, rolling and bouncing balls, space ships…</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>CharacterControl</td><td>Use for upright characters (persons, animals) that moves and stands orthogonally to the X/Z plane. It is not affected by directional forces or gravity and it does not fall over (as a RigidBodyControl&#039;ed spatial would), a CharacterControl&#039;s spatial is permanently locked locked upright (as a walking character would). </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>GhostControl</td><td>Use for collision and intersection detection between physical entities. A GhostControl is <em>non-solid</em> and invisible, and it moves with the Spatial it is attached to. Use this for interactive game elements that do not have a visible solid Geometry: A monster&#039;s &quot;aggro radius&quot;, motion detectors, photoelectric alarm sensors, poisonous or radioactive perimeters, life-draining ghosts, etc. </td>
	</tr>

</table></div>
<!-- EDIT2 TABLE [7519-8845] -->
</div>

<h3><a>PhysicsControls Code Samples</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

The various Physics Control constructors expect a Collision Shape (here thingShape) and a mass (a float).
</p>
<pre>RigidBodyControl myControl=new RigidBodyControl&#40; thingShape , 1.0f &#41;;</pre>

<p>
To make the Physics Control visible in the scene, you must attach the Control to a Geometry (e.g. a model named myGeometry):
</p>
<pre>myGeometry.addControl&#40;myControl&#41;;</pre>

<p>
This code sample creates a physical Character:
</p>
<pre>// Load any model
Node model = &#40;Node&#41; assetManager.loadModel&#40;&quot;Models/myCharacterModel.mesh.xml&quot;&#41;;
rootNode.attachChild&#40;model&#41;;
// Create a appropriate physical shape for it
CapsuleCollisionShape capsuleShape = new CapsuleCollisionShape&#40;1.5f, 6f, 1&#41;;
CharacterControl character_phys = new CharacterControl&#40;capsuleShape, 0.01f&#41;;
// Attach physical properties to model and PhysicsSpace
model.addControl&#40;character_phys&#41;;
bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.add&#40;character_phys&#41;;</pre>

<p>
<p><div>Spheres and Boxes can fall back to the correct default CollisionShape if you do not specify a CollisionShape in the RigidBodyControl constructor. 
</div></p>
</p>

<p>
For example, the following creates a box with the correct Box Collision Shape:
</p>
<pre>Box&#40;1,1,1&#41;;
myBox.addControl&#40;new RigidBodyControl&#40; 1.0f &#41;&#41;; // implicit BoxCollisionShape
bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.add&#40;myBox&#41;;</pre>

</div>

<h2><a>Physics Space</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

The Physics Space is an object in BulletAppState that is like a rootNode for Physics Controls. It manages global settings.
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> You can specify parameters such as gravity and accuracy.<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.setGravity&#40;new Vector3f&#40;0f,-1f,0f&#41;&#41;;
bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.setAccuracy&#40;0.005f&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add all PhysicsControls to the PhysicsSpace.<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.add&#40;myPhysicsControl&#41;; ...</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add each PhysicsControl to a Spatial. <pre>myModel.addControl&#40;myPhysicsControl&#41;; ...</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Attach the Spatial to the rootNode, as always. <pre>rootNode.attachChild&#40;myModel&#41;; ...</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

You remove physical entities from the scene by removing their PhysicsControl from the PhysicsSpace and also their Spatial from the rootNode: 

</p>
<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.remove&#40;myPhysicsControl&#41;;
myModel.removeFromParent&#40;&#41;;</pre>

</div>

<h2><a>Best Practices</a></h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div> You can control the game by triggering forces; or may want to respond to collisions, e.g. by substracting health points, or by playing a sound. To specify how the game responds to physics events, you use <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/physics_listeners.html">Physics Listeners</a>.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> Do not overuse PhysicsControls. Although PhysicsControls are put to “sleep” when they are not moving, creating a world solely out of dynamic physics nodes will quickly bring you to the limits of your computer&#039;s capabilities.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> You can use normal non-physical Spatials in the same scene next to physical ones. Use the non-physical ones for non-solid things for which you do not want to detect collisions (ghost, foliage, plants, effects, …). This improves performance.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> If you get weird behaviour, such as physical nodes jittering wildy and being ejected &quot;for no apparent reason&quot;, it usually means you have created an impossible state. Verify that none of the collision shapes overlap. This can happen when you create physical nodes in positions that are too close to other nodes; or if you position a physical node using setLocalTranslation() and it touches another node&#039;s collision shape. </div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> For large static meshes like shooter levels or terrain it is best to divide the scene model into multiple physics entities, with each its own CollisionShape. A huge city level should not be one huge mesh (model) of pavement and streets and buildings. Instead, you make individual models for buildings, for pieces of pavement, for pieces of streets, etc. Position them next to one another to form the whole city, and give each piece its own optimal CollisionShape. E.g. streets can use a fast PlaneCollisionShape if you keep them separate for buildings. Breaking the level into manageable pieces helps the engine improve performance: The less CPU-intensive <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer"><param name="content" value="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_and_prune"><param name="text" value="<html><u>broadphase</u></html>"><param name="textColor" value="blue"></object> can now filter out parts of the scene that are behind you or out of reach, and it only calculates the details of collisions for parts that are actually close to the action.</div>
