<h1><a>Physics: Gravity, Collisions, Forces</a></h1>
<div>

<p>

A physics simulation is used in games and applications where objects are exposed to physical forces: Think of games like pool billiard and car racing simulators. Massive objects are pulled by gravity, forces cause objects to gain momentum, friction slows them down, solid objects collide and bounce off one another, etc. Action and Adventure games also make use of physics to implement solid obstacles, falling, and jumping.

The jMonkeyEngine3 has built-in support for <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer"><param name="content" value="http://jbullet.advel.cz"><param name="text" value="<html><u>jBullet Physics</u></html>"><param name="textColor" value="blue"></object> (based on <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer"><param name="content" value="http://bulletphysics.org"><param name="text" value="<html><u>Bullet Physics</u></html>"><param name="textColor" value="blue"></object>) via the <code>com.jme3.bullet</code> package. This article focuses mostly on the RigidBodyControl, but also introduces you to others.

<h2><a>Technical Overview</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

Bullet physics runs internally at 60fps by default. This rate is not dependent on the actual framerate and it does not lock the framerate at 60fps. Instead, when the actual fps is higher than the physics framerate the system will display interpolated positions for the physics objects. When the framerate is lower than the physics framerate, the physics space will be stepped multiple times per frame to make up for the missing calculations. You create a Bullet PhysicsSpace in jME3 with a <code>com.jme3.bullet.BulletAppState</code>. 
</p>

<p>
Internally, the updating and syncing of the actual physics objects happens in the following way:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> collision callbacks (<code>BulletAppState.update()</code>)</div>
</li>
<li><div> user update (<code>simpleUpdate</code> in main loop, <code>update()</code> in Controls and AppStates)</div>
</li>
<li><div> physics to scenegraph syncing and applying (<code>updateLogicalState()</code>)</div>
</li>
<li><div> stepping physics (before or in parallel to <code>Application.render()</code>)</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

When you use this physics simulation, values correspond to the following units:
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> 1 length unit (1.0f) equals 1 meter, </div>
</li>
<li><div> 1 weight unit (1.0f) equals 1 kilogram,</div>
</li>
<li><div> most torque and rotation values are expressed in radians.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2><a>Physics Application</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

A short overview of how to write a jME application with Physics capabilities:
</p>

<p>
Do the following once per application to gain access to the <code>physicsSpace</code> object:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Make you application extend <code>com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication</code>.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Create a BulletAppState field: <pre>private BulletAppState bulletAppState;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Initialize your bulletAppState and attach it to the state manager: <pre>public void simpleInitApp&#40;&#41; &#123;
    bulletAppState = new BulletAppState&#40;&#41;;
    stateManager.attach&#40;bulletAppState&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

<p><div>In your application, you can always access the <code>BulletAppState</code> via the ApplicationStateManager: 
</p>
<pre>BulletAppState bas = app.getStateManager&#40;&#41;.getState&#40;BulletAppState.class&#41;;</pre>

<p>

</div></p>
</p>

<p>
For each Spatial that you want to be physical:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Create a CollisionShape.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Create the PhysicsControl from the CollisionShape and a mass value.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add the PhysicsControl to its Spatial.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add the PhysicsControl to the PhysicsSpace.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Attach the Spatial to the rootNode (as usual).</div>
</li>
<li><div> (Optional) Implement the <code>PhysicsCollisionListener</code> interface to respond to <code>PhysicsCollisionEvent</code>s.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

Let&#039;s look at the details: 
</p>

</div>

<h2><a>Create a CollisionShape</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

A CollisionShape is a simplified shape for which physics are easier to calculate than for the true shape of the model. This simplication approach speeds up the simulation greatly.
</p>

<p>
Before you can create a Physics Control, you must create a CollisionShape from the <code>com.jme3.bullet.collision.shapes</code> package. (Read the tip under &quot;PhysicsControls Code Samples&quot; how to use default CollisionShapes for Boxes and Spheres.)

</p>

All non-mesh CollisionShapes can be used for dynamic, kinematic, as well as static Spatials. (Code samples see below)

	<tr>
		<td> HullCollisionShape        </td><td> A less accurate shape for dynamic Spatials that cannot easily be represented by a CompoundShape. <br/>

	</tr>
</table></div>
<!-- EDIT2 TABLE [5821-7338] -->
<p>

The mesh-accurate shapes can use a CollisionShapeFactory as constructor (code samples see below).
</p>

<p>
<p><div>Pick the simplest and most applicable shape for the mesh for what you want to do: If you give a box a sphere collision shape, it will roll; if you give a ball a box collision shape, it will sit on a slope. If the shape is too big, the object will seem to float; if the shape is too small it will seem to sink into the ground. During development and debugging, you can make collision shapes visible by adding the following line after the bulletAppState initialization: 
</p>
<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.enableDebug&#40;assetManager&#41;;</pre>

<h2><a>Create PhysicsControl</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

BulletPhysics are available in jME3 through PhysicsControls classes from the com.jme3.bullet.control package. jME3&#039;s PhysicsControl classes directly extend BulletPhysics objects and are the recommended way to use physics in a jME3 application. PhysicsControls are flexible and can be added to any Spatial to make it act according to physical properties. 

</p>
<div><table>

</p>

</div>

<h3><a>PhysicsControls Code Samples</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

The PhysicsControl constructors expect a Collision Shape and a mass (a float in kilogram). The most commonly used PhysicsControl is the RigidBodyControl:
</p>
<pre>RigidBodyControl myThing_phys = 
    new RigidBodyControl&#40; myThing_shape , 123.0f &#41;; // dynamic</pre>
<pre>RigidBodyControl myDungeon_phys = 
    new RigidBodyControl&#40; myDungeon_shape , 0.0f &#41;; // static </pre>

<p>
<p><div>When you create the PhysicsControl, the mass value makes an important distinction: Set the mass to a non-zero value to create a dynamic object that can fall or roll, etc. Set the mass value to zero to create a static object, such as floor, wall, etc. If you give your floor a mass, it will fall out of the scene! 
</div></p>
</p>

<p>
The following creates a box Geometry with the correct default BoxCollisionShape:
</p>
<pre>Box&#40;1,1,1&#41;;
Geometry box_geo = new Geometry&#40;&quot;Box&quot;, b&#41;;
box_geo.addControl&#40;new RigidBodyControl&#40; 1.0f &#41;&#41;; // explicit non-zero mass, implicit BoxCollisionShape</pre>

<p>

The following creates a MeshCollisionShape for a whole loaded (static) scene:

</p>
<pre>...
gameLevel.addControl&#40;new RigidBodyControl&#40;0.0f&#41;&#41;; // explicit zero mass, implicit MeshCollisionShape</pre>

<p>
<p><div>Spheres and Boxes automatically fall back on the correct default CollisionShape if you do not specify a CollisionShape in the RigidBodyControl constructor. Complex static objects can fall back on MeshCollisionShapes.
</div></p>
</p>

</div>

<h2><a>Add PhysicsControl to Spatial</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

For each physical Spatial in the scene:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Add a PhysicsControl to a Spatial. <pre>myThing_geo.addControl&#40;myThing_phys&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Remember to also attach the Spatial to the rootNode, as always!</div>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h2><a>Add PhysicsControl to PhysicsSpace</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

The PhysicsSpace is an object in BulletAppState that is like a rootNode for Physics Controls. 

</p>
<ul>
<li><div> Just like you add the Geometry to the rootNode, you add its PhysicsControl to the PhysicsSpace. <pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.add&#40;myThing_phys&#41;; 
rootNode.attachChild&#40;myThing_geo&#41;; </pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> When you remove a Geometry from the scene and detach it from the rootNode, also remove the PhysicsControl from the PhysicsSpace: <pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.remove&#40;myThing_phys&#41;;
myThing_geo.removeFromParent&#40;&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p><div>You can either add the <em>PhysicsControl</em> to the PhysicsSpace, or add the PhysicsControl to the Geometry and then add the <em>Geometry</em> to the PhysicsSpace. jME3 understands both and the outcome is the same.
</div></p>
</p>

</div>

<h3><a>PhysicsSpace Code Samples</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

The PhysicsSpace also manages global physics settings. Typically, you can leave the defaults, and you don&#039;t need to change the following settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> Specify physics accuracy.<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.setAccuracy&#40;1f/60f;&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Specify global gravity. <pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.setGravity&#40;new Vector3f&#40;0, -9.81f, 0&#41;&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Specify the size of the physics space as two opposite corners (only applies to AXIS_SWEEP broadphase).<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.setWorldMax&#40;new Vector3f&#40;10000f, 10000f, 10000f&#41;&#41;;
bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.setWorldMin&#40;new Vector3f&#40;-10000f, -10000f, -10000f&#41;&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2><a>Specify Physical Properties</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

After you have registered, attached, and added everything, you can adjust physical properties or apply forces.
</p>

<p>
On a RigidBodyControl, you can set the following physical properties.

</p>
<div><table>
	<tr>

	<tr>
		<td> setGravity(new Vector3f(0f,-9.81f,0f)) </td><td> You can change the gravity of individual physics objects after they were added to the PhysicsSpace. Gravity is a vector pointing from this Spatial towards the source of gravity. The longer the vector, the stronger is gravity. <br/>
If gravity is the same absolute direction for all objects (e.g. on a planet surface), set this vector globally on the PhysicsSpace object and not individually. <br/>
If the center of gravity is relative (e.g. towards a black hole) then setGravity() on each Spatial to constantly adjust the gravity vectors at each tick of their update() loops.</td><td>For planet earth: <br/>

<p><div>It is technically possible to position PhysicsControls using setLocalTranslation(), e.g. to place them in their start position in the scene. However you must be very careful not to cause an &quot;impossible state&quot; where one physical object overlaps with another! Within the game, you typically use the setters shown here exclusively.

PhysicsControls also support the following advanced features:

<p><div> You can <code>setApplyPhysicsLocal(true)</code> for an object to make it move relatively to its local physics space. You would do that if you need a physics space that moves with a node (e.g. a spaceship with artificial gravity surrounded by zero-g space). By default, it&#039;s set to false, and all movement is relative to the world.

<h2><a>Best Practices</a></h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Multiple Objects Too Slow?</strong> Do not overuse PhysicsControls. Although PhysicsControls are put to “sleep” when they are not moving, creating a world solely out of dynamic physics objects will quickly bring you to the limits of your computer&#039;s capabilities. <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Improve performance by replacing some physical Spatials with non-physical Spatials. Use the non-physical ones for non-solid things for which you do not need to detect collisions – foliage, plants, effects, ghosts, all remote or unreachable objects.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Complex Shape Too Slow?</strong> Breaking the level into manageable pieces helps the engine improve performance: The less CPU-intensive <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer"><param name="content" value="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_and_prune"><param name="text" value="<html><u>broadphase</u></html>"><param name="textColor" value="blue"></object> filters out parts of the scene that are out of reach. It only calculates the collisions for objects that are actually close to the action. <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> A huge static city or terrain model should never be loaded as one huge mesh. Divide the scene into multiple physics objects, with each its own CollisionShape. Choose the most simple CollisionShape possible; use mesh-accurate shapes only for the few cases where precision is more important than speed. For example, you can use the very fast <code>PlaneCollisionShape</code> for flat streets, floors and the outside edge of the scene, if you keep these pieces separate.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Buggy?</strong> If you get weird behaviour, such as physical nodes jittering wildy and being ejected &quot;for no apparent reason&quot;, it means you have created an impossible state – solid objects overlapping. This can happen when you position solid spatials too close to other solid spatials, e.g. when moving them with setLocalTranslation(). <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Use the debug mode to make CollisionShapes visible and verify that CollisionShapes do not overlap. <pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.enableDebug&#40;assetManager&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Need more interactivity?</strong> You can actively <em>control</em> a physical game by triggering forces. You may also want to be able <em>respond</em> to collisions, e.g. by substracting health, awarding points, or by playing a sound. <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> To specify how the game responds to collisions, you use <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/physics_listeners.html">Physics Listeners</a>.</div>
